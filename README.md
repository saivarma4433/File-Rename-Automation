# File-Rename-Automation

File-Rename-Automation is a Google Apps Script project designed to automate the process of renaming files stored in Google Drive. 
Using JavaScript, this script allows users to batch rename files based on custom rules such as adding prefixes, suffixes, or numbering them in sequence. It's perfect for organizing large sets of files without the need to rename them manually.

Steps::

Create a New Google Apps Script Project:

Open Google Apps Script and create a new project.
Clone the Project:

If you haven’t already, clone this repository to your local machine or copy the script to your clipboard.
